# portmap

This is the portmap module. Only created with Debuntu in mind but should be trivial enough to add a distro checker in portmap::params

# Sample usage
<pre>
include portmap
include portmap::disable (to stop service)
include portmap::absent (to remove package / service)
</pre>

Or if you want to customize settings
<pre>
class { "portmap": 
  bind => "127.0.0.1",
  ensure_version => latest
}
</pre>
